		<p>Taught by: Dr W. K. Ivins</p>

		<h3>Outline Description of Module</h3>

		<p>Information systems are usually a major business investment so there is a need to ensure they are appropriately designed, developed, implemented and managed in order to ensure that the expected business benefits are achieved. It is important that Information Systems evolve to ensure they can continue to support the organisation’s needs. This module aims to develop the technical, business and management understanding to enable individuals to define and justify effective information systems to support business activities. It also provides an awareness of the skills necessary to manage projects, and knowledge of the relevant human and organisational factors that can influence the successful introduction of and subsequent support of information systems.Students will apply their knowledge and skills in a business change project which will involve team and individual tasks.
		<br>
		In addition, the module aims to equip students with an awareness of current trends in the development of information systems, and to identify and critically evaluate the factors involved in selecting the most suitable combination of technology, development and management approach to meet the organisation’s requirements. </p>

		<h3>On completion of the module a student should be able to</h3>

		<ol>
			<li>Understand the nature of organisations and the people within them, and their use of information for strategic and operational business purposes. </li>
			<li>Research and critically evaluate current trends and developments in constructing Information Systems and assess their impact on the strategy of organisations</li>

		<h2><a class="modulenames" id="207">CMT207 - Information Modelling &amp; Database Systems</a></h2>

		<p>Taught by: Mr T. Vanasescu</p>

		<h3>Outline Description of Module</h3>

		<p>Database systems are the most widely used software systems in commerce and industry. Database management systems are used to store and manage the complex integrated information resources of organisations. This module introduces the theoretical and practical issues relating to the design and use of these systems. In addition to the provision of a sound foundation in traditional, second generation database systems, it explores the representation and management of complex information resources with third generation database technology. The module highlights how database systems are at the core of modern information-rich Web sites, and explores the role of XML, JSON and Semantic Web technologies in creating a “Web of data”. Systems for data mining and business intelligence will be discussed. </p>

		<h3>On completion of the module a student should be able to</h3>
			
		<ol>
			<li>Understand how to map conceptual models to efficient representations in a database schema.</li>
			<li>Understand the latest types of DBMS – relational, object oriented, object- relational, non-relational, cloud, distributed.</li>
			<li>Understand the role of database systems in information-rich Websites.</li>
